			Monroe County Tax Collector Addresses Printing Error of Tax Bills<br /><br />

			Property owners may receive incorrect tax bills printed on Charlotte County’s tax bill paper.<br
			/><br />

			Key West, Fla. – Monroe County’s Constitutional Tax Collector Sam C. Steele announced that his
			office was informed by their print vendor, TC Delivers, who handles the printing and mailing of
			property tax bills and also serves the Charlotte County Tax Collector, that they inadvertently
			mailed 35,469 tax bills with Monroe County names and addresses printed on Charlotte County’s tax
			bill paper, displaying Charlotte County’s property tax values.<br /><br />

			Tax Collector Steele noted that he has been contacted by numerous Monroe County taxpayers
			understandably concerned about these erroneous tax bills, especially after receiving their
			correct tax bills last week. “I completely understand the concerns and frustrations, and I want
			to assure everyone that this was not a data breach, but rather an error and lack of quality
			control on the vendor’s part that should have been easily avoided,” said Steele. “I have
			addressed this oversight with the print vendor to ensure it does not happen again.”<br /><br />

			Steele immediately contacted Charlotte County Tax Collector Vickie Potts to discuss the issue
			caused by their shared vendor, who has accepted full responsibility for the mistake. After
			investigating, both Steele and Potts are confident there was no malicious intent or security
			breach. “It’s a huge error,” said Laura Ferreira, National Account Manager for TC Delivers. “I
			can never explain how truly sorry we are for causing this issue.”<br /><br />

			“As your Tax Collector, I want to reassure all Monroe County taxpayers that no data breach has
			occurred, and that payments made through our website are encrypted, safe, and secure. My office
			is fully committed to safeguarding public funds and confidential information by adhering to
			rigorous security protocols designed to protect your data,” Steele added.<br /><br />

			For any questions or clarification regarding their 2024 property tax bills, taxpayers can call
			the Monroe County Tax Collector’s Property Tax Department at (305) 295-5044.<br /><br />
