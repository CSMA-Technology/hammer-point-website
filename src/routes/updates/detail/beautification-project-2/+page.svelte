			<p>
				We are pleased to announce, that the much awaited 2nd phase of the Main Entrance
				Beautification, will be getting underway in the next month.
			</p>
			<p>
				We had a little delay getting the water meter and sprinkler installations squared away, as
				well as procuring a landscaper, but that has all been accomplished.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are contracting with Florida Keys Landscaping, who will prepare the beds and do the
				planting.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your neighbors. Todd and Linda Flack, have graciously agreed to donate the plants. We are
				truly grateful to the Flack Family for their generosity and commitment to our neighborhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will use mostly Native Plants, to support the environment of the Upper Keys, conserve
				water, reduce maintenance, waste and pollution and create a wildlife habitat. Hopefully we
				can be designated as a Florida Friendly Garden by the Monroe County UF/IFAS Extension
				(University of Florida/ Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences)
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to extend a special thank you, to all of you who have generously donated to this
				project and we appreciate your patience. Hopefully soon you can see the impact of your
				contributions.
			</p>
			<p>We will keep you posted on the projects progress</p>
			<p>Thank You,</p>
